# ReactRender

Renders React as HTML

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `react_server_render` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:react_render, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/react_server_render](https://hexdocs.pm/react_server_render).

## Usage

* Run `mix react_render.install` install the node react render service into your project

```bash
mix react_render.install
```

This installs a folder called `render_server` into your priv directory by default.
It contains the react render setup. The command will also ask if you would like to run `npm install`.

* Add `ReactRender` to your Supervisor as a child

```elixir
  render_server_path = "path/to/render_server/index.js"

  worker(ReactRender, [render_server_path])
```

* Call `ReactRender.get_html/2`

```elixir
  component_path = "./HelloWorld.js"
  props = %{name: "Revelry"}

  ReactRender.get_html(component_path, props)
```

`component_path` must be relative to your render server. The server will make sure that any changes you make are picked up. It does this by removing the component_path from node's `require` cache. If do not want this to happen, make sure to add `NODE_ENV` to your environment variables with the value `production`.

# ServerSideRender

A Plug and GenServer for Server Side Rendering of JavaScript frameworks such as React.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `react_server_render` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:server_side_render, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/react_server_render](https://hexdocs.pm/react_server_render).

## Usage

* Add `ServerSideRender.Server` to you Supervisor as a child

```elixir
  render_server_path = "path/to/server.js"
  host = http://localhost
  port = 3001

  worker(ServerSideRender.Server, [render_server_path, host, port])
```

**Note** Make sure that your server.js exits on EOF. Do so by adding the following somewhere in your script

```js
process.stdin.on('end', () => {
  process.exit()
})
```

* Add the `ServerSideRender` plug to your router or pipeline.

```elixir
plug ServerSideRender
```

From here, you would make your actions affected by the plug return json. These will be your props.

If the content-type is `application/json` then the json will be sent. If the content-type is `text/html` then it will send the json to your render server to be used as props. The render server should then return html which will be displayed.
